There was once a Chameleon and a Bearded Dragon.
The Chameleon asked "Bearded Dragon, the most Lizardly of Lizards, whose Lizardhood is undisputed by all, what are Gila monsters like?"
Bearded dragon looked at Chameleon and said "Chameleon, you and I think about Lizards differently. They are more than just their color."
Chameleon thought to themselves "I am a lizard."
Chameleon thought to themselves "Does bearded dragon not think I am a lizard?"
Chameleon thought to themselves "Does bearded dragon not know I know there's more to lizards than their color?"
Chameleon thought to themselves "Did I say or do something to make Bearded Dragon think that?"
Chameleon then got very quiet. Chameleon did not feel like a lizard. Chameleon was sad, and felt like less than a lizard.
Chameleon began to spiral, their colors shifting and whirling. Bearded dragon kept talking, but slowed at Chameleons display.

Bearded dragon sighed and began talking to Skink.

Chameleon did not know what to do. Chameleon's feelings were very hurt, but they also did not want to upset Bearded Dragon.
So Chameleon hid. Chameleon cried. Then Chameleon did nothing. They sat in their feelings and said nothing.
